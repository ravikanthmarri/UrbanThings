# UrbanThings

This project has been build as MacOS - Cocoa Framework so that there is no overhead of launching simulator every time we run Unit tests.

Result is printed to console.

In task 1 and task 2 branches, my main focus was on completing functionality.

Code refactoring is done in task3 brach, which also contains task1 and task2.
